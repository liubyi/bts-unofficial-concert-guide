        This post contains many pieces of advice from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8y3v1m/does_anyone_have_some_advice_with_first_time_at_a/">this Reddit post</a>. I've consolidated some of the most helpful comments.

        The basics.

      <div class="section"> 
        There's not a lot of space. Bring only what you need, like your phone, power bank, charger, tickets, wallet, ARMY bomb, cash, and water (if allowed, check your stadium policy). If water was not allowed, buy water before the concert starts. A couple bucks spent is better than passing out from dehydration.

        Know the bag policy.

      <div class="section"> 
        It will be different at every stadium. You don't want to be turned away at the front of the security line. For Rose Bowl, they do have a $10 bag check fee but it costs money and it wastes people's time. Rose Bowl only allows a 12" x 6" x 12" clear plastic bag or a small clutch (4.5" X 6.5" or smaller). Anything larger (even a clear backpack) or camera/binocular case are not allowed. Rose Bowl also prohibits banners, signs, unauthorized cameras, etc. Rose Bowl does allow 2 bottles of water per person, 17 oz or less, factory sealed, so don't open them until you're inside!

        Pro tip #1: Bring Earplugs.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Seriously. Someone on Reddit mentioned that the pain was so bad they had to stuff toilet paper in their ears halfway through the concert. Protect your ears; you want to be able to hear BTS's future music, right? If you can afford it, buy concert ear plugs because you don't want to miss out on the actual music when trying to block out the screaming.

        Here are some earplugs recommended by Redditers:

        Pro-tip #2. Bring medication/painkillers/cough drops.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        If you did not follow advice #1, you probably need Tylenol/Advil for your headaches/earaches. Bring cough drops too since your throat will probably be sore from screamng. Someone also mentioned bringing vitamins if you're worried about passing out. 
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        What do I wear?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. BTS won't know if you're wearing sneakers or stilettos. Maybe dress in layers, since it could be hot during the day and cooler at night. Bring hat and sunscreen if you're planning to line up during the day. If you're short, consider wearing comfortable platform shoes, since people may be standing the entire time.

        Should I bring binoculars if I'm in the back?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Although it may be distracting when using the binoculars, the camera may not always be pointed at who you want to look at or if the camera isn't recording the entire choreo. Someone said if you don't end up using them you may be able to return them...

        If you're dedicated enough to camp for merchandise, know what you're getting yourself into and go prepared.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        With stadium tours, the lines will probably form a DAY OR TWO in advance. You need friends in line that can hold your spot while you run to the restroom (and make sure there are restrooms open at 2am). Bring food, water, blankets, sleeping bags, tents, and bags to hold all your merch. So unless you can handle sleeping outside all night(s?), do not camp for merch.
