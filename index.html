        I love BTS, corgi butts, and pancake hamsters. If you have more concert advice you would like to share, or if you want to point out some inaccuracies, contact me at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stob__it">u/stob__it</a>. I've tried giving credit to Reddit users who provided particularly helpful information, but if you don't want your username on my site then I will glady remove them.

        I AM NOT AN EXPERT, so DO NOT quote me on anything, especially legal matters. I am merely an ARMY who has wasted countless hours crawling through BTS concert Reddit threads. The information I learned helped me get tickets, and may help me safely sell my extra tickets without being scammed. I am merely trying to give back to the community by consolidating information that may be helpful to others.
