        BUYING TICKETS
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        This post is inspired by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AgentEnterprise">/u/AgentEnterprise</a>'s' <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqKWOu4gseCe9a5i87PUvb_74l_8TKLbE3ReRlVObB8/edit">Deviwinter’s Guide to Concert Tickets</a>. Some of the tips in the article are outdated, so I have included updates and added my own ticket buying experience.

        What do I do before tickets go on sale?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Since the latest stadium concerts have sold out in under 2 hours, I recommend setting aside 3 hours to buy tickets. If you absolutely cannot miss school/work, ask friends and family for help, and use as many devices as you can. If possible, check out ticket prices and seat locations ahead of time. Check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/asdjka/2019_love_yourself_tour_megathread_iii_speak/">Reddit Tour Megathread</a> for updates.

        Are presale tickets legit?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Tickets that are on sale before the official time/date are "speculative tickets." They don't actually have those tickets; they're hoping they can beat the crowd and get those tickets before other fans on the official sale date. This is unfair and they may not actually get tickets. Only buy from official sites!
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        How much are tickets?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Ticket prices vary, so check the website and Reddit threads often. For the Rose Bowl Love Yourself: Speak Yourself concert, tickets were $55 - $250 US. Expect to pay around $300 - $400 for VIP/soundcheck. Note: soundcheck tickets cannot be resold. 
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        What if I want to sit with my friends?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Decide ahead of time the number of tickets, the max price, and seating area. It is advisable to buy in smaller groups (2-3) because the larger the group, the harder it is to find seats together. On the day of the sales, make sure everyone is communicating (phone/voice chat is the best) because if you wait too long to decide anything the good tickets will be gone. Prioritize high demand tickets (VIP, soundcheck) before going back and buying upper level tickets. For more tips see /u/AgentEnterprise's guide linked above. 
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        Are standing tickets worth it?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        The stadium tours are all seated, so I have no experience regarding standing tickets. Please refer to /u/AgentEnterprise's guide linked above. 
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        How does the queue work?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        For the stadium concerts, there has been a queue system where you can join a waiting room around 15 minutes before the official sale, and be placed in a random spot in the queue. Join the queue on all of your devices. Unless the page/app crashes, DO NOT REFRESH. If ticketing opens and all of your devices are at the back of the queue (if it tells you there are hundreds/thousands ahead of you), tickets will likely sell out before you reach the front, so follow the next trick.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        How do I beat the queue?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Use Ticketmaster's <a href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/What-is-the-Ticketmaster-sales-phone-number?language=en_US">automated phone system</a> to buy tickets. Start doing this during prequeue and keep trying. You may go through on the first try, or the second, or the hundredth. Get your family/friends to call too. Based on Twitter and Reddit discussions, people who had no luck with the queue were able to get tickets! I called 30 minutes after waiting and got decent tickets. If I had called earlier (right when the queue opened or even during prequeue) I think I would've gotten floor tickets.

        How does Ticketmaster's automated phone system work?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Have your credit card, the seat layout of the stadium, and pen and paper ready. Speak clearly, because if you say something that sounds like you're finished the bot will hang up on you and you will have to call (perhaps many times) again. There is no way to choose a specific section/seats, but you can either give them a price or say "best available". When the bot offers you a seat, look on your stadium map to see the approximate location. If you choose "best available" and the options seem kinda lame, it is because the good tickets have already been sold. If you absolutely want to go to the concert, buy them now, because by the time you hang up, call (dozens more times), those tickets may be gone. The tickets will be mailed to you, and all you will have is an order number (which you have written down).
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        How do I know if I actually bought the tickets through phone?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Wait until sales are over and the phone lines aren't jammed (like the next day), and call Ticketmaster's customer support line. Given them the order number, and ask for tickets to be emailed to you instead. You need to do this within a day or two before they actually mail out your ticket. For me, standard mail would've taken two weeks (an additional $3 added to your order) and UPS would've taken 2-3 days (an additional $14 added to your order).

      <div class="heading">
        What if a family member/friend bought soundcheck for me (since those are nontransferable and an ID is required to verify identity)?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yikeshands">u/yikeshands</a> said: I used my parent’s credit card to buy VIP SOUNDCHECK. In the confirmation email, the fine print says that if you want to add an alternate pick up name for will call, you must do so within 10 days of the purchase date. I emailed Ticketmaster the order number, the alternate pick up person’s name, the original buyer’s name, address, and last 4 digits of their credit card. TM okayed me as the alternate pick up and asked that I bring my photo ID, a photocopy of my parent’s ID, and the confirmation email. EDIT 1: I can confirm that this is for VIP SOUNDCHECK only. People with a standard ticket will get their ticket through email or delivery. VIP is will call only. EDIT 2: Email vip.tickets@ticketmaster.com to add an alternate pickup name.

      <div class="heading">
        What do I do if I bought too many tickets?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/asdjka/2019_love_yourself_tour_megathread_iii_speak/">Love Yourself Tour Megathread</a> subreddit to sell to fellow ARMYs. DO NOT RESELL FOR HIGHER THAN FACE VALUE (ticket and fees). We don't want to be like the scalpers, and remember that it would mean the world to some ARMYs to be able to see BTS. For more tips see the section on <a href="resell.html">How To Avoid Scams</a>.

        What do I do if I couldn't get the seats I wanted?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/asdjka/2019_love_yourself_tour_megathread_iii_speak/">Love Yourself Tour Megathread</a> subreddit to see if you can sell/trade your tickets. If you can't, remember that there will be thousands of ARMYs who did not get tickets, and will kill for yours. No matter where your seat is, you will have an amazing time. There are huge screens set up so you can every drop of sweat on their faces. You will be surrounded by ARMYs. You will see BTS live.

      <div class="heading">
        What do I do if I couldn't get tickets?
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Do not give up until the day of the concert. Check the website, check the subreddit where ARMYs resell tickets at face value. See if they will announce another date (for the stadium tours, the first day sold out so fast they annouced a second date after). People resell tickets back to Ticketmaster so keep checking there. Some people say Stubhub is legit and you will get your money back if the tickets were fake, but it is way overpriced, so check your other options first. If you live near the concert venue, consider buying tickets the day before. They will be really, really cheap since those people are trying to get rid of them.
