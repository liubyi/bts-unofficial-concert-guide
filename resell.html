        First, check out Reddit's Europe and North America Marketplace threads.

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/aw7m55/speak_yourself_tour_buyselltrade_megathread_na/">NA Marketplace Thread</a>
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        The North American thread has a spreadsheet of sellers and a form you can fill out to sell your tickets. Please do not sell them above face value (ticket cost + fees). 
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wtd6jNSOpbnKRh765KF1WTfxikzaKhAjK4NTIGJFXRk/edit#gid=1033898918">Tickets for sale/trade</a>

        Protect yourself from scammers.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Watermark your tickets and cover up any personal information and barcode when showing proof of purchase. Otherwise that information can be used by scammers.
      </div>


      <div class="heading">
        Do not buy third party soundcheck tickets unless approved by Ticketmaster. 
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
        Soundcheck packages may require the ID of the buyer, making them non-transferrable. DO NOT buy soundcheck tickets from third party sellers (sites or other fans) without contacting Ticketmaster and making sure the transfer is valid. See the <a href="tickets.html">Buying Tickets</a> page for advice if a friend/family member bought soundcheck tickets for you.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        Choose your payment method wisely. 
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
         When buying tickets from strangers online always use Paypal Goods and Services. Do not agree to it if they insist on using something else like Zelle, Venmo, or Google Pay because these do not have fraud protection and you will not get your money back once you send it to the scammer. If they insist on anything other than Paypal or meeting in person, don't buy from them, and warn other ARMYs too.
       </div>

      <div class="heading">
        Get proof of the ticket. 
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
         If it's a physical ticket, ask the seller to post a picture with the time and their social media info. This prevents a scammer from reusing online photos. If it's an e-ticket, ask for a screenshot with the time visible. If they don't send it immediately, it's a bit suspicious. Also ask for images of the email with their name on it.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">
        See if the price is reasonable. 
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
         It's suspicious if a ticket is lower than face value, because real sellers wouldn't want to lose money. Face value + fees = possible real ticket.
       </div>

       <div class="heading">
        Try to buy local first so you can meet the seller in person.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
         Don't go alone, meet at a public place, etc.
       </div>

      <div class="heading">
        Ask questions a real ARMY would know. Check their social media for BTS related activity.
      </div>

      <div class="section"> 
         Make sure the questions can't be googled easily, and make sure their responses are timely and reasonable. To be honest, I would want to call/text them and see if they can hold a BTS related conversation. I want to know if they're ARMY and I think they would want to know if I was ARMY too. If they aren't willing to do so, move on to someone else.
